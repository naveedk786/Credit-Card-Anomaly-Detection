# Credit-Card-Anomaly-Detection
BBDS Client Project
## Train an unsupervised model to detect potentially fraudulent credit card transactions.
1.  Anomaly Detection model for a client to detect fraudulent credit card transactions that can be applied as a Real Time application.
2.  Additional tools were also developed to prevent credit card holders to exceed their credit limits.
3.  Analyzed various anomaly detection techniques: Isolation Forest, Local Outlier Factor (LOF), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and compared them for the accuracy.
4.  Performed Clustering analysis to analyze the trasnactions clusters.
5.  Optimal anomaly detection technique was presented to the client along with key recommendations to enhance fraud detection capabilities and development of additional data features collection for future model enhancements.
