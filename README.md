# Credit-Card-Anomaly-Detection
BBDS Client Project
## Train an unsupervised model to detect potentially fraudulent credit card transactions.
1.  Use an unsupervised algorithm to return a list of all anomalous transactions that may be worth investigating further.
2.  Write a function that can be run every day to detect if any customer exceeds his/her monthly limit.
3.  Return a list of customers who went over their monthly limit in the most recent month.
