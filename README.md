# Credit-Card-Anomaly-Detection
BBDS Client Project
## Train an unsupervised model to detect potentially fraudulent credit card transactions.
1. Team leader: Architected an Agile Unsupervised anomaly detection ML model for fraudulent credit card transactions. Able to flag 20% of 233k transactions as anomalous. 
2. Developed algorithms and prevented 9 to 15% credit card holders to exceed their credit limits.
3. Performed Feature Engineering and Feature Selection using Geocoder APIs.
4. Analyzed and compared various anomaly detection model: Isolation Forest, Local Outlier Factor (LOF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) and compared for the accuracy. Achieved 91% accuracy with Isolation Forest.
5. Presented optimal anomaly detection technique to the client along with key recommendations to enhance fraud detection capabilities and development of additional data features collection for future model enhancements.
